FORTHOS

(A forth interpreter as a operative system.) Standalone forth interpreter.

This is based on :
"A FORTH compiler and tutorial - a step-by-step implementation of a FORTH language system."
on http://annexia.org/forth

and in Bran's Kernel Development Tutorial, by Brandon Friesen at 
http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/title.htm


Port to nasm started by jdinuncio (Jos√© Dinuncio)

At moment some  bugs;
Only for learning and hobby.
My intention was to learn nasm and forth basics and NaturalDocs.
The forth is not very usefull. There is no floppy acces , no memory menager,   no ports  etc.... available.
I think it is only for learning.

Thats it.

REMARK

for compiling the source you need nasm ver.2.0x 
compiling with nasm 0.98 in UBUNTU 8.04 failed!!!

August (augustulus@freenet) tested the kernel with  qemu.
